# Web Technologies Coursework

Welcome to my repository for my Web Technologies project (SET08101). In this project I created a web application which is designed to enhance user reaction times and memory through interactive games. This website is ideal for anyone wanting to try it out as it was designed to be just a fun little website.

In this project I created a series of games specifically designed to train and measure reaction times and develop memory retention. Each game is designed with a scoring system that decides how quick you are so that users are challenged to improve their skills.
