        <h1>Web Development Project - User Benchmark</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Web Development Project, this website was created as an entertaining way for users to help develop their cognitive abilities whilst meeting the academic requirements for this project.</p>
        <p>This website contains a series of games designed to develop and enhance your reactions and memory. Whether you're here to kill some time,</p>
        <p>improve your cognitive abilities, or just have some fun, this website is designed to provide both entertainment and a bit of friendly competition.</p>
<br>
        <h2>The Games</h2>

           <p><b>Reaction Test:</b> This test is to help develop a user's response to stimuli and test a user's response and see how it measures up to others.</p>
           <p><b>Click Speed Test:</b> This test is to help you increase your ability to move your finger as quickly as possible - It has no real benefit but it sure is fun!</p> 
           <p><b>Number Memory Test:</b> This test is to help you increase your short term memory by giving the user a progressively larger number they need to remember before the time runs out.</p> 

<br>
        <h2>Scoring System</h2>
        <p>To add a fun twist and a competitive edge, we've incorporated a unique scoring system.</p>
        <p>Since we don't have a database to store user results for comparison, we've come up with a creative solution: animal speed classifications!</p>
            <p>  Depending on your game scores, you'll be ranked as one of the following animals, each symbolizing a range of quickness:</p>
<br>
        <p><b> Swordfish:</b> The epitome of speed in the water - If you're here, you're among the fastest!</p> 
            <p><b>    Clownfish:</b> Representing the average speed of a sea animal.</p> 
                <p><b>  Sea Snail:</b> One of the slowest sea creatures - Everyone starts somewhere, but there's always room to improve.</p>
